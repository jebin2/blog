# Pointer Arithmetic

Weâ€™ll see what happens if we add or subtract to a pointer address.

To understand this, letâ€™s take a simple 1D array example:

```c
int *matrix = malloc(rows * sizeof(int));
```

When we allocate a 1D array of length `rows` with `sizeof(int)`, it creates memory in a continuous block.

---

Letâ€™s say:

```c
int *temp_mat = malloc(rows * sizeof(int));

temp_mat[0] = 0;
temp_mat[1] = 1123;
```

Just assigning some sample values.

Now check this:

```c
printf("temp_mat: %d", *(&temp_mat[0] + 1));
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s happening step by step

* `&temp_mat[0]` â†’ gets the address of the first element
* `+ 1` â†’ moves the pointer forward by one element (not just 1 byte, but `sizeof(int)` bytes)
* `*` â†’ dereferences it, so we get the value at the next index

---

### ðŸ“¦ Memory Diagram

Suppose `rows = 4`, memory might look like this:

```
Index   Value
-----------------
[0]     0
[1]     1123
[2]     (garbage / uninitialized)
[3]     (garbage / uninitialized)
```

Now:

* `&temp_mat[0]` â†’ points to index **0**
* `(&temp_mat[0] + 1)` â†’ points to index **1**
* `*(&temp_mat[0] + 1)` â†’ gives value at index **1** â†’ `1123`

---

Thatâ€™s basically **pointer arithmetic** â€” we can do math on pointers to move around memory, and then dereference to get the value.
